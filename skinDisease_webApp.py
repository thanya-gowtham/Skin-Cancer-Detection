It appears as rough, scaly patches on the skin, commonly found on the face, scalp, ears, and hands. If left untreated, actinic keratosis can develop into squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. These lesions are often red or brown, with a sandpaper-like texture."

It often appears as a pearly or waxy bump with visible blood vessels, commonly on sun-exposed areas such as the face and neck. Although not highly aggressive, bcc can cause significant local tissue damage if left untreated."

They include conditions such as seborrheic keratosis and solar lentigines, which typically appear as brown, rough, or scaly patches. Although harmless, these lesions can sometimes be mistaken for more serious conditions like melanoma."

It often appears as an irregularly shaped, dark-colored mole with uneven borders. If not detected early, melanoma can spread rapidly to other parts of the body, making early diagnosis and treatment crucial."

It usually appears as a firm, small, dark brown or reddish nodule on the skin, often found on the legs. Dermatofibromas are harmless and do not require treatment unless they become bothersome or painful."

Moles can appear anywhere on the skin and vary in color from light brown to black.

These lesions often appear as red or purple spots on the skin and are usually benign. Although vascular lesions are generally harmless, some may require treatment for cosmetic reasons or if they cause discomfort."
